The starting project for this workshop is located in the [MyWeatherHub](https://github.com/andrejonland/bouvet-bergen-fagdag-dotnet-aspire/tree/main/MyWeatherHub) folder. This project is a simple weather API that uses the National Weather Service API to get weather data and a web frontend to display the weather data powered by Blazor.

## Workshop modules

Instructions with learning modules is found here: [Workshop Instruction Modules](https://github.com/andrejonland/bouvet-bergen-fagdag-dotnet-aspire/tree/main/Instructions)

## Demo data

The data and service used for this tutorial comes from the United States National Weather Service (NWS) at https://weather.gov We are using their OpenAPI specification to query weather forecasts. The OpenAPI specification is available online. We are using only 2 methods of this API, and simplified our code to just use those methods instead of creating the entire OpenAPI client for the NWS API.
